        <h1> The MyFitHabit story </h1>

        <p> MyFitHabit, one of the Kosovo's first new-wave healthy bars, was founded in 2019 by Erin Orana and Zymer Bregtalia in Ferizaj with the aim of creating fitness drinks
          2.0.
          Erin
          was sick of
          trying to serve his consumers with so-called drinks at [REDACTED], the quality were extremely volatile at that time. The idea of setting his own bar
          up dates
          back to that time. All he had to do was to find one man who could make drinks. At that time Zymer was highly recommended. <br>

          Zymer was one of the first home brewers in the country. Like many others in the industry, he started to brew at home in the kitchen. Finally, he was so impressed by the
          creative
          world of brewing, so he left his university teaching career to set up an illegal brewery for his friends. From morning to night, he experimented different drink in his
          secret "lab"
          until he became a gipsy (contract) brewer, where he could make his recipes in large quantities in different breweries. By this time, his groundbreaking drinks became more
          and more
          popular in a wider range of consumers. <br>

          They both finally went all in and took all their assets and energy and they built MyFitHabit Brewing for almost half a year. The goal in the first minute was the same as
          today: the
          production of uncompromising drinks for consumers </p>

        <h1>5 Years of MyFitHabit</h1>
        <p>

          In the last five years, the initial staff of 4 has been transformed into a team of 13 and the number of bars has doubled. We brewed more than 80 different types of
          drinks,
          which we
          have already exported outside of Europe to Mexico, Canada and even China. We brewed drinks together with the bands Quimby and Ivan & The Parazol, the bishop of
          Székesfehérvár, and
          even the Hungarian national goalkeeper Adam Bogdán made his drink in MyFitHabit. Tokaj aszú pomace, Basque cheesecake and freshly arrived oysters from the French coast
          all
          ended up in
          our brew house. We went to the most prestigious festivals in Europe, from Spain to Russia, and won numerous awards for our drinks in foreign and domestic competitions.
          Humor and
          craziness are not far behind us, so we are in a lot of craziness, but if we have to, we make a stand for serious topics and the values ​​we think are important.

          Perhaps, what we are most proud of is the strong and active community behind the MyFitHabit brand, formed over the years. Besides many experiences and positive feedback
          we are
          pleased
          to think of “MyFitHabit, the adopted pug, “Flying Rabbit” tattoos in your arms, or the guy who drew his girlfriend on a drinks label in our graphic style for her
          birthday.
          Without you,
          MyFitHabit Brewing would not be complete. </p>
